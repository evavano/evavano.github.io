<h1>Welcome to my personal website.</h1>
<p>Here, you can learn more about me and my studies</p>

<br>

<h3>About me</h3>
<p>Hi! I am Eva. In February 2017, I started the master Earth Sciences at the University of Amsterdam. Before that, I earned a bachelor degree in Earth Sciences at the VU university in Amsterdam, specializing in geology en geochemistry. Because I wanted to learn more about other earth sciences related topics, I choose to change universities for my master studies. However, my main interests are still in geology related topics, like volcanic petrology. At the UvA, I try to develop skills in data science, statistics, the use of GIS and remote sensing and I want to gain more general knowledge in geomorphology.  My interest in earth science, and geology in particular, combined with sports made me a passionate hiker and backpacker. My summers are spend mostly in remote, mountainous parts of the world. </p>

<h3>Studies and skills</h3>
<b>Data analysis and statistics</b>
<p>In my bachelor studies I mainly developed skills in the field and lab. This did not include (much) data analysis and statistics.  At the UvA, I try to develop my data skills, because I think understanding statistical output and being able to analyze your data is key in various situations. I will be using data analysis and statistics during my master project. At this point I am still a beginner but with every project I develop more skills and knowledge. At this point I am familiar with RStudio, Excel and MATLAB for doing basic statistical analysis and visualization of data.</p> 

<b>General computational skills</b>
<p>During the ‘Analysis and Modelling’ course at the UvA, I had projects using RStudio, MATLAB, but also on general computational skills. The latter was a module were I learned about the Unix Shell, data storage and version control on GitHub, preparing data using OpenRefine and Excel, SQL using SQLite and finely creating a website on GitHub using HTML. Before the General Computation Skills module I was not familiar with most of this, but they provide a very useful set of skills that I can definitely use when I have to handle data in the future. More important, it made me more familiar with computational thinking, so I am able to search better and more efficiently for solutions whenever I run into problems using a computer or doing analysis.</p> 

<b>GIS and remote sensing</b>
</p>I am also developing skills in GIS and remote sensing. Being able to use GIS has many implementations in earth sciences and beyond. After taking a few courses and using GIS for several fieldworks, I am familiar with creating a geodatabase, adding metadata, data visualization and spatial analysis. </p>
